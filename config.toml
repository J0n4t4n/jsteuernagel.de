I love combining different software together to create something useful.<br><a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/camera/?ref=jsteuernagel.de\">📷</a> I haven't been photographing for as long and am still learning new things every time. By now I know a lot about my camera but I'm still trying to wrap my head around how to properly edit them, especially when it comes to color grading.<br>🌳 In recent years I have started to become increasingly interested in the environment and what is required to avoid damaging it further.<br>Further things I am interested in: 🔒 Privacy, 🏡 Tiny Houses, 💡 Minimalism.<br>If you can relate to any of these points, then feel free to look around my blog. You can also get in touch with me on:"
